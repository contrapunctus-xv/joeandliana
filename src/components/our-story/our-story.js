                <p>How do two souls in a city of over 8 million find each other?<br/>Online.<br/><br/></p>
                <p className="subheader">In November 2014, Liana downloaded the dating app, Coffee Meets Bagel,<br/>with low expectations and little hope.<br/> How could an algorithm find love?</p>
                <p className="subheader">Three days and three uninteresting matches later, she deactivated the app.</p>
                <p className="subheader">That same day, Joe got a match on Coffee Meets Bagel that piqued his interest.<br/> A girl holding a pint of freshly picked raspberries in the summer sun. <br/>He pressed the <span className="fa fa-heart-o fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></span> icon, hoping for a mutual match.</p>
                <p className="subheader">Maybe it was a <i>glitch</i>. Or maybe it was <i>fate</i>.</p>
                <p className="subheader">Two days after deactivating the app, and at the urging of a close girlfriend,<br/> Liana reactivated her profile. <br/> "Just go on <i>one</i> date with <i>someone</i> !"</p>
                <p className="subheader">That first day back online, her match was a fellow Cornellian.<br/>He was also pretty cute and best of all, he liked classical music!<br/>She pressed the <span className="fa fa-heart-o fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></span> icon for the first time.</p>
                <p className="subheader">Those two days of radio silence after Joe liked his match were disheartening.<br/>The matches expire after a day. Maybe it wasn't meant to be.</p>
                <p className="subheader">But then, a notice - "One of your bagels liked you!"<br/><br/></p>

                <p className="text-body">The First Date</p>
                <p className="subheader">After chatting on the in-app messaging platform, they decided to meet up at Lincoln Center to get tickets for a concert.<br/>They noticed an advertisement for 30 under 30 - three tickets for $30 each for young adults under 30. Three concerts are better than one, right?</p>
                <p className="subheader">"So, I guess we're committing to at least three more dates with each other," joked Joe as they tucked the tickets into their pockets.</p>
                <p className="subheader">Coffee, dinner, drinks, and two orders of late night dumplings in St. Marks later, they knew this was it.</p>
                <p className="subheader">They both deactivated and deleted the app on their phones, and they ended up going to way more than three concerts together.</p>
